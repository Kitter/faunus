Faunus is a "property graph":https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/Property-Graph-Model analytics engine based on "Hadoop":http://hadoop.apache.org/. A "breadth-first":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search version of the graph traversal language "Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com operates on a "vertex-centric":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list property graph data structure. Faunus can be extended with new operations written using "MapReduce":http://hadoop.apache.org/mapreduce/ and "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com.

*Faunus was renamed Titan-Hadoop and merged into "Titan":https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan as of version 0.5.0.  Faunus is now part of and maintained in the same repository as Titan.  It is contained in the Titan release downloads and pushed to Maven Central as the titan-hadoop module.  The Faunus documentation in version 0.5.0 and later is part of the Titan manual available at "http://s3.thinkaurelius.com/docs/titan/current/":http://s3.thinkaurelius.com/docs/titan/current/.  The pages and downloads on this wiki only apply to Faunus versions 0.4 and earlier.*
